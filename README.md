# jeopardy

An simple online version of the gameshow Jeopardy

Improved refers to the fact that I have attempted at making a web-based version of Jeopardy using JavaScript's Canvas.
This improved version does not use Canvas, instead it focuses more on the HTML side, which significantly improved
the performance of the game. Hence, the reasoning to "improved jeopardy."
